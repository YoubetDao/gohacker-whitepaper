# GoHacker Whitepaper

Gitcoin showed the world that builders matter. We’re taking that vision further: No forms, no grant games. Just build, get ranked, get rewarded.  
Powered by Virtuals Infra and ACP, GoHacker teams up with other agents to build the best open-source launchpad to support builders who ship.

## Problem Statement

**The Developer Blind Spot in Crypto Investment**

Great developers are the foundation of every successful project — yet often overlooked by investors. The current crypto investment landscape suffers from several critical issues:

- **Speculation Over Substance**: Investors focus on hype and marketing rather than technical fundamentals
- **Invisible Builders**: Developer contributions are undervalued and often invisible to the investment community
- **Lack of Technical Due Diligence**: No standardized way to evaluate project technical health and developer activity
- **Underfunded Quality Projects**: Many promising open-source projects lack funding and recognition

We believe when developers are visible and fairly rewarded, better projects emerge, and Web3 becomes more than just a speculation game.

## Solution

**A Developer-Centric Evaluation Platform**

GoHacker provides a comprehensive solution to bridge the gap between developers and investors through five key components:

### 1. GitHub Analysis Engine & Builder Leaderboard

Our core evaluation system analyzes GitHub repositories to provide deep insights into project health:

- **Repository Activity Scoring**: Track commit frequency, issue resolution, and code quality metrics
- **Contributor Network Analysis**: Map developer influence and collaboration patterns
- **Technical Debt Assessment**: Evaluate code maintainability and architectural decisions
- **Builder Leaderboard**: Rank projects and developers based on technical contributions and impact

### 2. Deep Research Agent & X-Bot

AI-powered research tools that deliver instant project evaluations:

- **X-Bot Integration**: Instant GitHub-based evaluations through our official X account
- **Deep Research Agent**: Personalized AI investment assistant based on developer metrics
- **Automated Due Diligence**: Generate comprehensive project evaluation reports
- **Real-time Insights**: Up-to-date project reports and developer credibility scoring

### 3. OSS Launch Pad

A crypto-native platform for open-source project funding and growth:

- **Project Fundraising**: Connect quality projects with investors who understand technical value
- **Contributor Recruitment**: Help projects find and onboard skilled developers
- **Milestone-Based Rewards**: Token distribution tied to actual development achievements
- **Community Building**: Foster sustainable developer ecosystems around promising projects

### 4. ACP Integration

Seamless integration with AI Agent protocols for enhanced capabilities:

- **Developer Insight APIs**: Enable all ACP-connected AI Agents to access our evaluation data
- **Agent Capability Assessment**: Evaluate AI Agent performance based on task completion and output quality
- **Cross-Platform Intelligence**: Aggregate insights from multiple AI agents for comprehensive analysis

### 5. According.Work Integration

Partnership for fair compensation and sustainable project funding:

- **Fair Compensation Mechanisms**: Ensure developers are rewarded based on actual contributions
- **Project Liquidity Management**: Integrate milestone rewards with funding flows
- **Sustainable Funding Model**: Support long-term project development through contributor-based economics
- **Community Governance**: Enable $BUIDL holders to participate in funding decisions and project direction

## Technology

### Graph-Based Evaluation System

Unlike traditional metrics that rely on superficial indicators like star counts or lines of code, GoHacker employs a sophisticated graph-based evaluation system that measures true influence and impact within the developer ecosystem.

#### Network Structure

Our evaluation system models the GitHub ecosystem as a heterogeneous graph with three primary node types:

- **Contributor Nodes**: Individual developers and their coding activities
- **Repository Nodes**: Open-source projects and their technical characteristics
- **Pull Request & Issue Nodes**: Code contributions that create connections between contributors and repositories

#### Graph-Based Influence Scoring

We adapt Google's PageRank algorithm to measure developer and project influence within the GitHub network:

$$R(i) = (1-d) \sum_{j \in |V|} \frac{W(j, i)}{D(j)} R(j) + d R(j)$$

Where:

- $R(i)$ = Rank score of node $i$
- $d$ = damping factor (typically 0.85)
- $V$ = total number of devs \ issues \ prs in the network
- $W(j,i)$ = weighted edge from node $j$ to node $i$ (contribution significance, collaboration strength)
- $D(j)$ = sum of all outbound edge weights from node $j$

## $BUIDL Utility

Holding $BUIDL allows users to:

- **Premium Access**: Advanced insights and automatic investment pipelines
- **Early Access**: Participate in early-stage airdrops
- **Contributor Rewards**: Directly reward contributors on According.Work
- **Project Support**: Donate to promising crypto projects via $BUIDL tokens and share in their long-term success
